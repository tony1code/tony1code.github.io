    <h1>The Science of Motivation: How to Stay Driven Every Day</h1>
    <img src="../images/motivation.jpg" alt="Person climbing a mountain symbolizing motivation" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;margin:20px 0;">

    <p>Motivation is the invisible force that pushes us to start projects, chase dreams, and keep moving forward despite challenges. While many see it as something mysterious, science reveals that motivation can be understood, cultivated, and sustained.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation</h2>
    <p>Psychologists divide motivation into two main types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Intrinsic Motivation</strong>: Comes from within — the joy of learning, personal satisfaction, or curiosity.</li>
      <li><strong>Extrinsic Motivation</strong>: Driven by external rewards — money, recognition, or avoiding punishment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Both types play important roles, but intrinsic motivation is more sustainable for long-term success.</p>

    <h2>The Dopamine Connection</h2>
    <p>When we make progress toward a goal, our brain releases dopamine — the "feel good" chemical. This reward system encourages us to repeat behaviors that lead to positive results. Breaking big goals into small steps allows for more frequent dopamine boosts, keeping us motivated.</p>

    <h2>Proven Strategies to Boost Motivation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Set Clear Goals</strong> — Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals give direction.</li>
      <li><strong>Visualize Success</strong> — Imagine the feeling of achievement to activate emotional commitment.</li>
      <li><strong>Reward Yourself</strong> — Celebrate milestones, no matter how small.</li>
      <li><strong>Surround Yourself with Positivity</strong> — People, quotes, and environments influence your drive.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Common Motivation Killers</h2>
    <p>Lack of sleep, negative environments, and unclear priorities can drain your energy. Identifying and eliminating these barriers is as important as building motivation.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Motivation is not a magical spark that comes and goes — it is a skill you can train. By understanding how it works and using practical strategies, you can stay consistent in chasing your dreams.</p>
